I just don’t know if that’s correct or not.\\n\\nAlso, I’ve heard that the airflow leading up to the leading edge of the wing has an upward draft and the airflow leaving the trailing edge of the wing has a downward flow, and this flow also corresponds to rotational energy in which we can also deduce that below the wing is a lower speed of airflow and above the wing is a higher velocity, but again i just don’t know if that’s correct.\\n\\nIf someone could explain, i’d be very grateful.

Your fuel is with you, not getting left behind or about to be outran, you start accelating... You continue to accelerate to a fraction below light speed until you hit light speed... and vanish from perception because we humans need light and/or electric machines to confirm reality with I guess.... \\n\\nBut the IFO still exists, it\\'s just \"now\" where we cant see it because by the time we look its already moved.

(Examples are not accurate, but just for the sake of *simp*licity) The equal opposite reaction is the ground pushing back on me, as it were, at 10N as well. The second law of motion states that force equals mass times acceleration. I am accelerating due to gravity, and have mass, and so it stands to reason that I am exerting force on the ground. Yet where is the 10N pushing back on me coming from? The ground has mass, yet I would not assume it is accelerating back towards me proportionate to its mass to produce the same amount of Newtons. How is this force being generated? Like it feels so silly to me because it is such a basic concept of life that things hold up other things, one thing can be on top of another.
